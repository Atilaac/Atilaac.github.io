Course content
====

The course was composed of 2h lecture and 2h handson tutorials per week.
- Monte Carlo simulation, basic principles
- Molecular dynamics, basic principles
- Solution of stochastic differential equations (Langevin dynamics)
- Focus projects that will depend on the interests of the participants 


Course Objectives
====

The main emphasis of this course is to teach you how to write your own code and less to inform you how to use programs written by others. We support C++ and python. 
Furthermore, we will use a Linux cluster during our tutorial hours. 


Tasks performed
====
- I handeled about a third of the lecture hours and 100% of the tutorial hours.
- I prepared mid-term exam questions
- I supervised two students for their final projects: 
1. mechanical properties of hydroxyapatite using MD simulations (Mechanical simulation of HA nanowires, Raúl Agut Lopez)
2. MD simulations of ferroelectric domain nucleation switching dynamics (Philipp Münzer)
