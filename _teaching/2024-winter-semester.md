Course content
====

The course was composed of 2h lecture and 2h handson tutorials per week.
- Monte Carlo simulation, basic principles
- Molecular dynamics, basic principles
- Solution of stochastic differential equations (Langevin dynamics)
- Focus projects that will depend on the interests of the participants 


Course Objectives
====

The main emphasis of this course is to teach you how to write your own code and less to inform you how to use programs written by others. We support C++ and python. 
Furthermore, we will use a Linux cluster during our tutorial hours. 


Tasks performed
====
- I handeled about a half of the lecture hours and 100% of the tutorial hours.
- I prepared mid-term exam questions
- I supervised two student for the final project: 
1. NANOINDENDATION OF MULTILAYERED Cu-Zr (BENGİSU AYDIN, MAHİMA HAQUE)
