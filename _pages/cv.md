Education
======
* Ph.D in Materials Science and Engineering, [Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg](https://www.fau.eu), 2023
* M.Sc. Physics and new technologies, [Haasan II university](https://www.univh2c.ma), 2017
* B.Sc. Physics and applications, [Hassan II university](https://www.univh2c.ma), 2015

Work experience
======
* Jan 2025 - : Postdoctoral scientist @ Federal Institute for Materials Research and Testing (BAM)
  * Design automated workflows for various atomistic simulations
  * Develop analysis tools for interpreting atomistic simulation data
  * Conduct simulations to investigate the mechanisms behind intermittent aging in glasses
  * Work on topics related to glasses, including bioactive glasses, metallic glasses, and mechanical properties.

* Jul 2022 - Dec 2024: Postdoctoral Research Associate @ Saarland University
  * Performed atomistic simulations that uncovered new mechanisms of ice friction 
  * Conducted the largest realistic atomistic simulations of nanoindentation in metallic glasses, revealing a potential link between the fragile-to-strong liquid transition and room-temperature mechanical behavior
  * Led side projects on the mechanical properties of glasses, bioactivity, phase separation in oxide glasses, and machine learning approaches to segregation spectrum analysis
  * Served as a teaching assistant for five semesters, delivering two hours of lectures and two hours of tutorials per week to master’s students
  * Created lecture content from scratch in theoretical materials physics and computational materials physics
  * Designed and led tutorials, wrote exam questions, and supervised students throughout the courses

* Jul 2021 - Dec 2022: Guest Scientist @ Max Planck Institute for Sustainable Materials

* Apr 2018 - Apr 2022: Research Associate @ Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg
  * Performed atomistic simulations to uncover the origins of structural anisotropy in oxide glasses
  * Studied the impact of defects on the mechanical behavior of oxide glasses
  * I contributed to side projects on the mechanisms of dislocation motion in Laves phases, bioactivity in oxide glasses, and some other topics related to glasses.
  * Participated as a teaching assistant in lectures by leading tutorial sessions and pre-courses on Linux and atomistic simulations
