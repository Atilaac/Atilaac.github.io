I am Dr. Achraf Atila. Currently, I work at the Bundesanstalt für Materialforschung und -prüfung in Berlin on atomistic simulations of inorganic glasses. I am a computational material scientist focusing on amorphous materials. I am strongly interested in the relationship between composition and physical properties of glasses.

Research interests: My research interests lie at the intersection of materials science and physics. Generally, I am interested in using atomistic simulations and data analysis tools to study and understand materials behavior under different conditions.
