In this talk I went through few topics that I studied during the years and explained to students what can be dine using molecular dynamics simulations. During 1h I walked the students on the topics listed below:
- What are glasses?
- introduction to the structure, and formation rules and theories of oxide glasses.
- What is molecular dynamics simulations?
- Anisotropic oxide glasses
- Bioactive oxide glasses
- Phase separation in binary aluminosilicate glasses
